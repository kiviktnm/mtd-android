# Mtd for Android

An Android client for mtd, a todo and task management app with built-in encrypted synchronization
support. See the [CLI app](https://github.com/Windore/mtd) too.

Mtd is a yet another todo app as enough of those don't exist yet. However, mtd has some benefits
over the existing apps, mtd has built-in synchronization, it's lightweight and has both a
[CLI](https://github.com/Windore/mtd) and an [Android](https://github.com/Windore/mtd-android) version. As
for security, all network transmissions for synchronization are encrypted using AES GCM.

For more information about mtd see the [CLI app](https://github.com/Windore/mtd).

## Installation

I will release an APK file soon.
